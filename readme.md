## üí° Installation

Install Clutch.js as a development dependency with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev clutchjs
```

## üìö Usage
Integrate Clutch.js into your project by using the following import statement:

```bash
const clutch = require('clutch.js');
```

More usage details can be found in the Documentation section.

## üë• Contributing
We welcome any contributions to Clutch.js! For information on how to contribute, please refer to our contributing guidelines.

## üß™ Testing
Run the following command to execute the pre-written tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Documentation

```javascript
const Clutch = require('clutch.js');
```

A sample function to demonstrate memoization
```javascript
const expensiveCalculation = (num) => {
    // hypothetically expensive calculations...
    return num * num;
}
```

Create a memoized version of the function
```javascript
const memoizedExpensiveCalculation = Clutch.memoize(expensiveCalculation);

// The initial call calculates and caches the result
console.log(memoizedExpensiveCalculation(5)); // Calculation performed

// Subsequent calls with the same parameter will use the cached result
console.log(memoizedExpensiveCalculation(5)); // Result retrieved from cache
```

Multithreading: Start new thread
```javascript
const myThread = new Clutch.Thread(() => {
  // ... long running task ...
});
```

Start the thread.
```javascript
myThread.start();
```

## üîó Integrating Clutch.js With Other Libraries

### Express.js and Clutch.js Integration Example

`Clutch.js` can be effectively used with `Express.js` to create multi-threaded servers for highly concurrent applications. Here are some basic steps to integrate these libraries:

Install Express.js and Clutch.js using npm, if they aren't already installed:

```bash
npm install express clutch.js
```

Then, use Clutch.js in your Express.js server like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Clutch = require('clutch.js');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const myThread = new Clutch.Thread(() => {
        // ...your complex operations...
    });
    
    myThread.start();

    res.send('Processing');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

In this example, Clutch.js is used to perform complex operations in a new thread for every incoming request, ensuring that the main thread isn't blocked and your server can accept more incoming connections while processing.

### MongoDB and Clutch.js Integration Example
Clutch.js can also be integrated with MongoDB to perform operations asynchronously. Here's how you can achieve this:

First, install MongoDB driver and Clutch.js using npm:

```bash
npm install mongodb clutch.js
```

Then, use Clutch.js in your MongoDB data processing tasks:

```javascript
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const Clutch = require('clutch.js');

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', function(err, db) {
    const myThread = new Clutch.Thread(() => {
        // ...your MongoDB operations...
    });
    
    myThread.start();
});
```

In this example, Clutch.js is used to process MongoDB operations in a new thread, ensuring that the main thread isn't blocked and your application remains responsive to other tasks.
